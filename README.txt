Computes and displays Pascal's triangle up to row n, where n is taken from the user. The user may optionally choose to have the triangle displayed according to 3 togglable settings: "Inverted", "Left-Justified", and "Display as Sierpinski's triangle".

If "Display as Sierpinski's triangle" is toggled, odd numbers will be displayed with a particular user-chosen background color, and even numbers with another user-chosen background color. This is known to produce Sierpinski's triangle when n is large enough.

The program was written in Haskell, however, a haskell compiler does not need to be installed to run the program. To run the program, simply download and run the executable file "main.exe". Source code can be found in "main.hs".

Note: May not work in Windows 10 and below.
